C Compiler Download README
==========================

CC5X Free Package

Please read all the following text before downloading the free package.

The free edition supports up to 1024 instructions in any single C module. Several modules can be linked together by MPLINK (the Microchip linker) to build larger programs. The variable size is limited to 16 bit, signed and unsigned, plus 24 bit floating point. The generated code is compact, but full optimization is not available.

Support is not available to users of the free edition. However, please report compiler bugs, documented according to the provided description. If you do this, expect the bug to be corrected in the next version released.

Restrictions: The free edition can be used to generate code for all prototype and non-commercial systems without restrictions. Any commercial use of the free edition is restricted (defined in  readme.txt). Permission is required to distribute the FREE edition. Making any changes to the compiler is strongly prohibited.

The downloadable packages contains example code and txt files. The compiler is a 32 bit console application that can be started from the command line and from many IDE applications (like MPLAB).

Download the file by using the right mouse button (browser dependent), and select Save Link As or Save Target As to save the file. Then start or unzip it.
